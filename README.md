# Opinionated boilerplate for a laravel-powered-api with a react SPA frontend

[![status](https://github.com/pstaender/laravel-api-react-frontend-boilerplate/actions/workflows/specs.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pstaender/laravel-api-react-frontend-boilerplate/actions)

## Requirements

  * PHP 8.1+
  * NodeJS 18+

## Features (tools, libraries and frameworks)

  * Laravel v10
  * React (with react-route, recoil, react-i18next and react-i18nify)
  * Parcel v2 (for building and developing JS, includes SCSS support and HMR)
  * jest for JS tests
  * github actions for ci (running php and js tests)

## Folder Structure

  * `/api`: Laravel application
  * `/frontend`: SPA js application
  * `/scripts`: script for building js app

## Setup

```sh
$ yarn install
$ cd api
$ composer install
$ php artisan key:generate
```

Copy `api/.env.example` to `api/.env`, setup value (name, db etcâ€¦). Then run to get laravel working:

```sh
$ php artisan migrate
```

Change for your app needs:

  * routes in `api/routes/web.php`
  * e-mail-templates `api/resources/views/emails`
  * change logo(s) `/logo.svg` and `/logo.webp`
  * Replace `yourserver.local` in the project with your production domain

## Development

```sh
$ yarn develop
```

## JavaScript production build

```sh
$ yarn build
```

It will generate all production-ready static files in the `/dist`-folder.

## Others

For testing e-mails in development, I recommend mailhog.

TS is not enabled (because I'm not using it). But parcel itself supports TS, so enabling TS should be easy.

## Disclaimer

This is (just) a boilerplate for creating (production-ready) laravel-driven api with a JS SPA as frontend. Please check all security related issues (e.g. CORS, database, mail and other settings) before deploying on production. Please also ensure that you run on the latest possible PHP (`composer update`) and NodeJS (`yarn update`) modules :)
